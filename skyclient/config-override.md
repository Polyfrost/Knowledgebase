## Mart

Use Mart to install Skyclient

## Manual Download

You can install mods manually via the `<your minecraft folder>/skyclient` folder. Run `/moddl` in the Discord server, which gives a direct download to all SkyClient mods. You can drag all mods to your mods folder, which you can locate via the `/mcfolder` command in the Discord.

## Manual Copy

You can also copy your existing config files, and then replace them after new Skyclient install.

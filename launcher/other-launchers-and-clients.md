description: Our policy on supporting other ways to play Minecraft.

# Info about other launchers and clients

## TL;DR

* We do not support cracked versions of the game.
* We do not support Badlion Client, Lunar Client, and other clients.
* We do not support Feather Client.
* Unless otherwise stated, we will not support alternate modloaders.
* If those work, cool. If those don't work, we will not help you.
* Other launchers should work fine assuming they don't interfere with the game too much.

## General policy

Our general policy is that if our products do not work on any products we state here to not support, then we will not help you.

## Cracked/pirated Minecraft

Our stance on cracked Minecraft is that we will not help you with any issues. These cracked Minecraft launchers also operate within legal grey/black areas.

Additionally, if you are using TLauncher, please uninstall it and change your passwords as it has been proven to be very shady and has lots of red flags.

## Clients (Badlion Client, Lunar Client, etc...)

These clients cannot be supported. This is because of their nature of being a locked-down Minecraft launcher, and also there's no way to reliably add them to clients. Additionally, they launch their own custom version of Forge/Fabric, so we cannot guarantee compatibility if you do manage them in.

## Feather Client

Feather Client has many issues in the past, but for the sake of simplicity, we will not support it, even in its current state as more of a launcher than a client. This is because:

* Like actual clients, Feather launches their own version of Forge/Fabric.
* Their versions of Forge/Fabric are obfuscated and closed-source, meaning it's hard for us to work with.

## Alternate modloaders (such as Legacy Fabric)

At the time of writing none of our mods support anything other than Forge (for 1.8.9) or Fabric (for modern versions). As such, unless otherwise stated we will not provide support for any other modloader besides those. This may change in the future so check back later.

## Other launchers (such as Modrinth App, ATLauncher)

Most other launchers should work normally as long as they are using the correct Forge/Fabric loaders and that they don't inject unnecessary/breaking changes into the game. That being said, we usually only provide support for Prism, Modrinth, and default launcher, and even with the default launcher we still recommend switching to Prism or Modrinth.

If you need help switching, you can follow Microcontrollers' guide on [switching to Prism or Modrinth](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/launcher/home/)

# Other Graphics Library Errors

## Possible Fixes

### Launcher

GDLauncher seems to cause strange issues with OpenGL. Tell the user to switch to Prism, Modrinth, or the vanilla Minecraft launcher.

### Monitor Refresh Rate

- If a user has two monitors, tell them to set both monitors refresh rate to 60hz and turn on borderless full screen in essential. Afterwards, they can set the monitors to the desired refresh rate.
- If a user doesn't have two monitors, tell them to lower the display's refresh rate until they find one that doesn't crash.
- If that still doesn't work, the user may need to go downgrade their drivers. Likely, choose a driver prior to December 2023.

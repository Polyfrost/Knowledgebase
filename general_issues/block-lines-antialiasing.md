# Problematic Block Lines - NVidia Antialiasing Issue

If the user sees lines on blocks, they most likely have an NVidia GPU or have antialiasing on. (which if so, just turn it off)

## Solutions

### Antialiasing

Turn antialiasing off.

### NVidia Control Panel

Navigate to 3D settings in the NVidia Control Panel and enable `Let the 3D application decide`.

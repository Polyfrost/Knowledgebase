# Ticket Management

We have a **VERY** strict rule against support in public channels.
This policy ensures that so we can continue to provide organized support.

If you see any form of someone asking for help in general in SkyClient or Polyfrost, immediately tell them to go to the support channel and make a ticket.

## Bumping

We want to have as few tickets open as possible. In order to encourage completing tickets, we use the `/bump` command to ask the user if their issue is resolved. If so, then we wish to close the ticket.

Here are some example scenarios of when to bump tickets.

### Scenario One

We've given a solution and the ticket poster affirms a suggestion--by saying, "ok" basically.
Ideally, we want as few tickets open as possible. So, even though it has been only 5 minutes since the user's last response, we run `/bump` to ensure that they don't need the ticket open.

### Scenario Two

The user has not said anything in ~6 hours. Generally, if they haven't said anything in over 30 minutes, then we can bump.

# Discord Suggestions Tags

Suggestions channel in Polyfrost discord.

{% embed url="https://discord.com/channels/822066990423605249/1265704794778243276" %}

## All Tags

- `OneConfig UX` - topics related to user accessibility or OneConfig design
- `OneConfig API` - developer-related API suggestions for OneConfig
- `Mods` - topics related to Polyfrost Mods.
- `OneLauncher` - topics related to OneLauncher
- `Meta` - topics related the Discord or Website

The poster will have the opportunity to choose a tag from the [All Tag](#all-tags) category.
If they choose the wrong categories, staff will fix it for them.

The Polyfrost devs will then read the post and give feedback.
If they haven't added a feature state tag, planned, not planned, or implemented, then go add the relevant one.

## Moderator / Support Only Tags

- `Planned / Not Planned` - Whether the suggestion is accepted or not
- `Implemented` - Whether the feature has been made
- `Duplicate` - Whether the feature has already been suggested before (regardless of whether it was accepted or not)
- `Invalid` - Whether the suggestion is invalid for any reason (e.g. a joke suggestion)

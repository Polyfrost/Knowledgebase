## Applying Tags

The poster will have the opportunity to choose a tag from the [All Tag](suggestion-tags.md#all-tags) category.\
If they choose the wrong categories, staff will fix it for them.

The Polyfrost devs will then read the post and give feedback.\
If they haven't added a feature state tag, planned, not planned, or implemented, then go add the relevant one.

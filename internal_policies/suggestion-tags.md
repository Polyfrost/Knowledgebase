## Moderator / Support Only Tags

- `Planned / Not Planned` - Whether the suggestion is accepted or not
- `Implemented` - Whether the feature has been made

## Applying Tags

The poster will have the opportunity to choose a tag from the [All Tag](#all-tags) category.
If they choose the wrong categories, staff will fix it for them.

The Polyfrost devs will then read the post and give feedback.
If they haven't added a feature state tag, planned, not planned, or implemented, then go add the relevant one.

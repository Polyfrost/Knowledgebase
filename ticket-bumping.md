# Ticket Bumping

## Examples

### Scenario One

We've given a solution and the ticket poster affirms a suggestion--by saying, "ok" basically.
Ideally, we want as few tickets open as possible. So, even though it has been only 5 minutes since the user's last response, we run `/bump` to ensure that they don't need the ticket open.

# Reading Logs

## Obtaining New Logs

In a ticket, if you suggest a fix to the user and they stay, "it still crashes," **ALWAYS MAKE THEM RE-SEND THE NEW LOG**
It is very possible that they are now experiencing a completely different issue!

## Finding Problematic Mods

Tl;dr, read the first couple lines of each exception line until you see a certain mod.

description: Our policy on supporting other ways to play Minecraft.

# Info about other launchers and clients

## TL;DR

* We do not support cracked versions of the game.
* We do not support Badlion Client, Lunar Client, and other clients.
* We do not support Feather Client.
* Unless otherwise stated, we will not support alternate modloaders.
* If those work, cool. If those don't work, we will not help you.
* Other launchers should work fine, assuming they don't interfere with the game too much.

## General policy

Our general policy is that if our products do not work on any of the products we state here, then we will not help you.

## Cracked/pirated Minecraft

We will not help you with any issues with cracked Minecraft. These cracked Minecraft launchers also operate within legal grey/black areas.

## Clients (Badlion Client, Lunar Client, etc...)

These clients cannot be supported. They are locked-down Minecraft launchers, and there's no way to reliably add them to clients.

## Feather Client

Feather Client has had many issues in the past, but for the sake of simplicity, we will not support it, even in its current state, as more of a launcher than a client. This is because their software is obfuscated and closed-source, meaning it's hard for us to work with.

## Pojav Launcher

At the time of writing, OneConfig is not 100% compatible with Pojav Launcher. However, a fix is underway, but there will be no ETAs given.

## Other launchers (such as Modrinth App, ATLauncher)

Most other launchers should work normally as long as they are using the correct Forge/Fabric loaders and that they don't inject unnecessary/breaking changes into the game. That being said, we usually only provide support for Prism, Modrinth, and default launcher, and even with the default launcher we still recommend switching to Prism or Modrinth.

If you need help switching, you can follow Microcontrollers' guide on [switching to Prism or Modrinth](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/launcher/home/)
